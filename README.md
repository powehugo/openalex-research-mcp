# OpenAlex MCP Server

## Multi-source scholarly gateway

Version 0.6 can run as a Streamable HTTP MCP gateway (`npm run start:http`) and adds these read-only sources to the existing OpenAlex tools:

- Semantic Scholar Academic Graph, citation/reference traversal, and Recommendations
- DataCite public DOI and research-object metadata
- arXiv search and normalized Atom metadata
- Crossref DOI lookup and metadata validation
- Federal Register document search and lookup
- Regulations.gov search when `DATA_GOV_API_KEY` is configured

Configure `S2_API_KEY` as a deployment secret. DataCite, arXiv, Crossref, and Federal Register do not require API keys for these public operations. `CROSSREF_MAILTO` is optional but recommended for polite API usage. EUR-Lex is intentionally deferred because its web service requires a separate account and credentials.

HTTP deployments expose the MCP endpoint at `/mcp` (override with `MCP_HTTP_ENDPOINT_PATH`) and an unauthenticated status endpoint at `/health`. Health responses report only whether secrets are configured, never their values.

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to OpenAlex, a comprehensive open catalog of scholarly papers, authors, institutions, and more. Designed to empower AI assistants to conduct literature reviews, analyze research trends, and map the scholarly landscape.

## Quick Install

```bash
npx openalex-research-mcp setup
```

This auto-detects your Claude Desktop config, prompts for your email and optional API key, writes the config, and verifies connectivity — all in one step. Restart Claude Desktop when done.

**Flags:**
- `--print` — print the config JSON without writing anything
- `--config-path` — print the detected config file path and exit
- `--email you@example.com --api-key YOUR_KEY` — non-interactive / scripted mode

**Features:**
- ⚡️ **In-memory caching** with TTL for fast repeated requests
- 🔄 **Retry logic** with exponential backoff for resilient API calls
- ✅ **Input validation** with Zod schemas
- 🏥 **Health check** tool for monitoring
- 📊 **31 specialized tools** for research
- 🎓 **Curated journal presets** — UTD24, FT50, AJG/ABS tiers, top AI conferences, and more
- 🏛️ **Institution group presets** — Ivy League, Top US, INSEAD+London, and more

## Use as a Claude Skill (lightweight alternative)

The same OpenAlex access is also packaged as a **Claude Skill** under
[`skill/`](skill/) — a token-frugal alternative to the always-on MCP server.
A skill loads into the agent's context only when invoked and shells out to a
small zero-dependency CLI, so it costs nothing while idle. Use the **MCP server**
in MCP clients (Claude Desktop, TypingMind); use the **skill** in coding agents
(Claude Code, etc.) that already have shell access.

```bash
chmod +x skill/bin/openalex && export PATH="$PWD/skill/bin:$PATH"
export OPENALEX_EMAIL="you@example.com"     # optional: faster polite pool
openalex works "supply chain network" -n 5
```

See [`skill/README.md`](skill/README.md) for install and the MCP-vs-skill
trade-off. (The industry is steadily shifting routine API access from always-on
MCP servers toward on-demand skills — this repo ships both.)

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to your Claude Desktop config file:

**MacOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Claude_<id>\LocalCache\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

> **Tip:** In Claude Desktop, go to **File → Settings → Developer → Edit Config** to open the correct config file directly. The `npx openalex-research-mcp setup` command also auto-detects the path.

**If you installed via npm/npx:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openalex": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "openalex-research-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENALEX_EMAIL": "your.email@example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**If you installed from source:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openalex": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/openalex-research-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "OPENALEX_EMAIL": "your.email@example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### TypingMind and Other MCP Clients

The same configuration format works for TypingMind and other MCP-compatible clients.

> **⚠️ TypingMind Users**: If you encounter "tool_use_id" errors, see [TYPINGMIND.md](TYPINGMIND.md) for troubleshooting steps and best practices. **TL;DR**: Start a new chat, request fewer results (5-10), and use specific queries with filters.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Literature Review for AI Safety

```
Find the most influential papers on AI safety published since 2020
```

The assistant will use `get_top_cited_works` with appropriate filters to find highly-cited papers in AI safety research. The tool automatically filters for papers with at least 50 citations by default, ensuring results focus on influential work. For the most impactful papers, you can specify a higher threshold like `min_citations: 200`.

### Example 2: Citation Network Analysis

```
Get the citation network for the paper "Attention Is All You Need" (DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762)
```

The assistant will use `get_citation_network` to build a network of citing and referenced papers, enabling visualization of research impact.

### Example 3: Research Trend Analysis

```
Show me how quantum computing research has evolved over the past 10 years
```

The assistant will use `analyze_topic_trends` to group publications by year and show growth patterns.

### Example 4: Finding Collaborators

```
Who are the main collaborators of Geoffrey Hinton?
```

The assistant will use `get_author_collaborators` to analyze co-authorship patterns.

### Example 5: Comparative Research Analysis

```
Compare research activity in "deep learning", "reinforcement learning", and "federated learning" from 2018-2024
```

The assistant will use `compare_research_areas` to show relative publication volumes.

### Example 6: Geographic Research Mapping

```
Which countries are leading research in climate change mitigation?
```

The assistant will use `analyze_geographic_distribution` to map research activity by country.

### Example 7: Top-Journal Citation Search

```
Find influential papers on "large language models" published in UTD24 journals since 2020
```

The assistant will use `search_in_journal_list` with `journal_list="utd24"` and `from_year=2020`.

### Example 8: Institution-Filtered Search

```
Find papers on supply chain resilience published by researchers at Harvard, Stanford, or MIT
```

The assistant will use `search_works` with `institution_group="harvard_stanford_mit"`.

### Example 9: Seminal Paper Discovery

```
What are the must-cite foundational papers in transformer models?
```

The assistant will use `find_seminal_papers` with `min_citations=500` to find highly-cited, older foundational works.

### Example 10: Expert Discovery

```
Who are the top researchers in reinforcement learning, and where are they based?
```

The assistant will use `search_authors_by_expertise` with `topic="reinforcement learning"`, sorted by h-index.

## Response Format

The MCP server uses a **two-tier response system** to balance performance and completeness:

### Summarized Responses (Search Results)

For list operations (`search_works`, `get_citations`, `get_author_works`, etc.), responses include only essential information:

**Included:**
- Core identifiers (ID, DOI, title)
- Publication metadata (year, date, type)
- Citation metrics (cited_by_count)
- First 5 authors (with `authors_truncated` flag if more exist)
- Primary topic classification
- Open access status and URLs
- Source/journal name
- Abstract preview (first 500 chars)

**Excluded to reduce size:**
- Full author lists beyond 5 authors
- All secondary topics/concepts
- Complete affiliation details
- Full reference lists
- Detailed bibliographic data

This optimization reduces response sizes by ~80-90% (from ~10 KB to ~1.7 KB per work), making the server compatible with all MCP clients including TypingMind and Claude Desktop.

### Full Details (`get_work` tool)

When you need **complete information** about a specific paper, use the `get_work` tool with a work ID or DOI. This returns:

**Complete Author Information:**
- ALL authors (not just first 5)
- Position indicators (first, middle, last author)
- Institutions and affiliations
- ORCID IDs
- Corresponding author flags
- Country information

**Complete Content:**
- Full abstract (reconstructed from OpenAlex index)
- All topics (not just primary)
- Complete bibliographic data
- Funding and grant information
- Keywords
- Complete reference and citation lists

**Use Cases:**
- Identifying PIs (often last author in biomedical fields)
- Finding corresponding authors
- Getting complete author affiliations
- Accessing full abstracts
- Comprehensive paper analysis

## Tool Reference

### Search Parameters

Most search tools support these common parameters:

- **from_year / to_year**: Filter by publication year range
- **min_citations**: Minimum citation count (e.g., `50` for solid papers, `200` for highly influential)
- **cited_by_count**: Citation filter with operator (e.g., `">100"`) — prefer `min_citations` for simplicity
- **source_name / source_issn / source_id**: Filter by journal or conference
- **author_institution**: Filter by author institution name (pipe-separated for OR, e.g., `"Harvard University|MIT"`)
- **institution_group**: Named institution group preset (e.g., `harvard_stanford_mit`)
- **is_oa**: Filter for open access works only
- **sort**: Sort results (`relevance_score`, `cited_by_count:desc`, `publication_year:desc`)
- **page / per_page**: Pagination (max 200 per page; default 10, use 20 for broader coverage)

### Boolean Search

The `search_works` and related tools support Boolean operators:

```
"machine learning" AND (ethics OR fairness)
"climate change" NOT "climate denial"
(AI OR "artificial intelligence") AND safety
```

### Identifiers

OpenAlex accepts multiple identifier formats:

- **OpenAlex IDs**: W2741809807, A5023888391
